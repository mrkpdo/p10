  This is my submission for Participation 10 linking and using a custom font. Rather than talk about my choices in making the font, I'd rather be talking about the process and struggles I first had trying to implement the new font. I thought the metaflop website was pretty interesting to use, while I didn't really utilize much of the settings, I thought it would be good to at least tweak the font to where it was slanted, and if it was implemented correctly, I would see the slant on the website. I had a lot of trouble pathing the font, using different videos and resources trying to understand what I did wrong. It was until the video that was posted, I was able to follow along and successfuly link the font, which was a lot easier than I was originally doing.
